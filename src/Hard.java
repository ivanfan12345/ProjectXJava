 * 18.1 Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators. ; , pg462
   18.2 Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffleâ€”in other words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.
   18.3 Write a method to randomly generates set of m integers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.
   18.4 Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).
   EXAMPLE
   Input: 25
   Output: 9 (2,12,20,21,22,23, 24 and 25. Note that 22 counts for two 2s.) pg 465
   18.5 You have a large text file containing words. Given any two words, find the shortest distance (in terms of number of words) between them in the file. If the operation will be repeated many times for the same file (but different pairs of words), can you optimize your solution? pg 48 8
   18.6 Describe an algorithm to find the smallest one million numbers in one billion numbers. Assume that the computer memory can hold all one billion numbers
